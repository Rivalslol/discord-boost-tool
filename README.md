4. Add your nitro tokens in assets/1m tokens / 3m tokens
5. Add your keyauth info in main.py on line 35-40
6. Run python main.py

# How to compile / build the exe
1. pip install pyinstaller
2. pyinstaller main.py --onefile
3. You might have to include the tls_client dll, to do so find ur lib path and change " --add-binary '{path_to_library}/tls_client/dependencies/tls-client-64.dll;tls_client/dependencies' " as needed.
4. if you are using the tls_client dll, it would look like this: pyinstaller main.py --onefile --add-binary (path to the lib / dll)

# YOU NEED A CAPMONSTER CREDITS AND NITRO TOKENS!
